    "\n",
    "Pretraining objectives are crucial components of the pretraining process for transformers. These objectives define the tasks that the model is trained on during the pretraining phase, allowing it to learn meaningful contextual representations of language. Two commonly used pretraining objectives are masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM):\n",
    "   Masked language modeling involves randomly masking some words in a sentence and training the model to predict the masked words based on the context provided by the surrounding words(i.e., words that appear either before or after the masked word). The objective is to enable the model to learn contextual understanding and fill in missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's how MLM works:\n",
    "   - Given an input sentence, a certain percentage of the words are randomly chosen and replaced with a special [MASK] token.\n",
    "   - The model's task is to predict the original words that were masked, given the context of the surrounding words.\n",
    "   - During training, the model learns to understand the relationship between the masked words and the rest of the sentence, effectively capturing the contextual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):\n",
    "   Next sentence prediction involves training the model to predict whether two sentences are consecutive in the original text or randomly chosen from the corpus. This objective helps the model learn sentence-level relationships and understand the coherence between sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's how NSP works:\n",
    "   - Given a pair of sentences, the model is trained to predict whether the second sentence follows the first sentence in the original text or if it is randomly selected from the corpus.\n",
    "   - The model learns to capture the relationships between sentences and understand the flow of information in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "   NSP is particularly useful for tasks that involve understanding the relationship between multiple sentences, such as question answering or document classification. By training the model to predict the coherence of sentence pairs, it learns to capture the semantic connections between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that different pretrained models may use variations or combinations of these objectives, depending on the specific architecture and training setup.\n"

    "\n",
    "In BERT, positional embedding, token embedding, and segment embedding are three types of embeddings used to represent the input tokens in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Token Embedding: Token embedding is the initial representation of each token in a BERT model. It maps each token to a dense vector representation of a fixed size, typically referred to as the embedding size. The token embedding layer in BERT learns the contextual representations of the input tokens. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the tokens and their relationships with other tokens in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional Embedding: BERT is a transformer-based model that processes the input tokens in parallel. However, since transformers don't inherently capture the order of tokens, positional embedding is used to inject positional information into the model. It adds a vector representation to each token that encodes its position in the input sequence. The positional embedding allows BERT to understand the sequential order of the tokens and capture their relative positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Segment Embedding: BERT can handle sentence pairs or sequences that have distinct segments or parts. To differentiate between different segments, such as sentences or document sections, segment embedding is used. It assigns a unique vector representation to each segment or part of the input. The segment embeddings help BERT understand the relationships between different segments and capture the context within and between them.\n"

    "To evaluate the performance of a pretrained BERT model in predicting whether a second sentence follows the first, a function called `predict_nsp` is defined. The function operates as follows:\n",
