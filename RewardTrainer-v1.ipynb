    "# Reward Modeling\n",
    "Imagine that you're working as a machine learning engineer for a large technology company that wants to integrate advanced language models into its suite of AI-powered products. Your task is to evaluate and select the best large language model (LLM) that can understand and follow complex instructions, improve the quality of automated customer service, and generate high-quality responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, simply choosing a powerful LLM isn't enough. To truly excel in these tasks, the model should be fine-tuned to align with specific goals and criteria. This is where reward models come into the picture. By training a reward model, you can guide the LLM to prioritize certain behaviors, ensuring it generates responses that not only meet technical standards but also align with the company's values and objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you dive into the process of creating and training a reward model by using the transformer reinforcement learner (trl) library from Hugging Face. You learn how to set up the environment, define the rewards that shape the model's behavior, and fine-tune the LLM to perform with precision. This project equips you with the skills to implement reward models in real-world applications, enhancing the effectiveness and quality of AI-powered products.\n"

Generally, a full-bodied red wine like Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah is a good choice, as its bold flavors can stand up to the rich flavors of the steak. Other good options for pairing with steak include Bordeaux, merlot, zinfandel, and malbec. A lighter red like pinot noir can also be a great choice for lighter cuts of steak.

But on the end, it will start with a bunch of cooked vegetables and a mixture of gravy.  It can also be served with potatoes, and some of the best sauce for potatoes is a mixture called a roux, which is usually served on corn, with a sauce on the end.  You can also make a chandoull paste, and that is somewhat similar.  There’s lots of stuff in a pan that goes on top of the sauce, such as gravy-shaped pieces.  But the gravy itself is made by cooking some of the vegetables down in a pan and adding a mixture of stock to the pan.  That mixture is called a roux, and it is a combination of cooked vegetable fragments, mixed with the stock.  In some cases, it can also be whipped up and served a bit like a a paste, so the point is to avoid making a cooked paste.  It can also be cooked and served on the side.  But the gravy would still be made by the cooking of the vegetables. \n",

This includes things like pumps, growing trays, grow lights, and nutrients. Once you've assembled the system, you'll need to add your choice of herbs to the system.

    "The code first tokenizes `text1` by using the tokenizer, converting it into the format required by the model. The `tokenizer` function processes the input text into tensors with padding and truncation to ensure uniform input length, up to a maximum of 512 tokens. The `inputs` are then moved to the GPU, if available, for faster computation. The `model` is also transferred to the GPU. The inputs dictionary is updated to move all of its items to the device (GPU or CPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is then used to generate outputs without computing gradients (`torch.no_grad()`), making the inference process faster and more memory-efficient. The score, the logits from the model's output, are extracted, representing the raw predictions. These logits are then passed through a sigmoid function to convert them into probabilities, which can be interpreted as the model's confidence in the projections. The resulting probabilities are printed or returned for further use.\n"
