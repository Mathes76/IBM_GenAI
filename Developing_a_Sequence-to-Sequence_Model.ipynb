    "RNNs are a class of neural networks designed to process sequential data.\n",
    "They maintain an internal memory($h_t$) to capture information from previous steps and use it for current predictions.\n",
    "RNNs have a recurrent connection that allows information to flow from one step to the next.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "-$ \\mathbf{x}_t $: input vector at time step $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "-$ \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} $: hidden state vector from the previous time step\n",
    "\n",
    "-$ \\mathbf{W}_x $ and $ \\mathbf{W}_h $: weight matrices for the input and hidden state, respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "-$ \\mathbf{b} $: bias vector\n",
    "\n",
    "-$\\sigma$: activation function (often a sigmoid or tanh)\n",
    "\n",
    "The update equations for the hidden state $ \\mathbf{h}_t $ and the output $ \\mathbf{y}_t $ are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that the hidden state function depends on the previous hidden state as well as the input at time t, which is why it has a collective memory of previous time steps.\n",

The input is a sequence of words in the original language(\"I love to travel\"), while output is its translation in the destination language(\"J'adore voyager\"). As shown in the video, input is fed into the decoder part, one word after another. Each RNN cell receives a word($x_t$) and has an internal memory($h_t$). After processing the input and $h_t$, RNN cell passes an updated context vector($h_{t+1}$) to the next RNN cell. When the end of sentence is reached, the context vector is passed to the decoder part. Decoder cells are also RNN cells that receive context vector and generate the output word by word. Each RNN receives the generated word as well as the updated context vector from its previous cell and generates the next word($y_t$). This architecture allows for generating text without length restrictions.\n"

    "\n",
    "To implement the encoder part using Pytorch, you will create the sub-class of the torch.nn.Module class and define the __init__() and __forward__() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first define the parameters that are used in __init__() function:\n",
    "- The `vocab_len` is nothing but the number of unique words present in the vocabulary. After pre-processing the data, you can count the number of unique words in your vocabulary and use that count here. This will be the dimension of the model input.\n",
    "- The embedding_dim is the output dimension of the embedding vector you need. A good practice is to use 256-512 for sample demo app like you are building here.\n",
    "- LSTM can indeed be stacked, allowing for multiple layers. In the initial implementation, you will use only one layer. However, to accommodate future flexibility, you will pass the parameter `n_layers` to specify the number of layers in the LSTM.\n",
    "- `hid_dim` is the dimensionality of the hidden and cell states.\n",
    "- `dropout` is the amount of dropout to use. This is a regularization parameter to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look into the layers:\n",
    "- The Embedding layer takes the input data and outputs the embedding vector, hence the dimension of those needs to be defined as `vocab_len` and `embedding_dim`.\n",
    "- The LSTM Layer takes the `embedding_dim` as the input data and creates total 3 outputs: `hidden`, `cell` and `output`. Here you need to define the number of neurons you need in LSTM, which is defined using the `hid_dim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the __forward__() function, the Embedding layer is defined that utilizes the `vocab_len` to internally convert the input_batch into a one-hot representation. Next, the LSTM layer receives the embedded input and outputs three vectors: Output, Hidden and cell. As for the encoder, you don't require the output vector from the LSTM as you only pass the context vector(`hidden`+`cell`) to the decoder block. Therefore, forward() only returns hidden and cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When using an LSTM, you have an additional cell state. However, if you were using a GRU, you would only have the hidden state.\n"

    "* Note: When working with PyTorch tensors that represent data, it's important to understand the conventions around representing sequences. In most cases, the rows (the first dimension) in a PyTorch tensor represent individual samples, while the columns (the second dimension) represent features or time steps in the case of sequences. When dealing with sequences in PyTorch, it's common to use functions like `pad_sequence` to ensure that all sequences have the same length. Surprisingly, the padding operation is applied along the second dimension (columns), even though sequences are typically represented in the first dimension (rows). This can be confusing at first due to the way batches of sequences are represented. In many sequence-related tasks in PyTorch, especially when working with recurrent models like RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, batches of sequences are usually represented with the shape [sequence_length, batch_size, feature_size], where `sequence_length` refers to the length of the longest sequence within the batch(here it is equevalent to `src_len` or `trg_len`). If you check the src tensor above, you can see that the first word of of all sentences are in the first line, the second word of all sentences are in the second line, etc. That is why the first dimension is the length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you use `pad_sequence`, it adds padding to the sequences in a batch so that they all have the same length, matching the length of the longest sequence. Since sequences are represented in the first dimension, the padding is applied along that dimension. As a result, the output tensor from `pad_sequence` will have the format [sequence_length, batch_size]. (Check the output for `src` and `trg` from the above cell.) This convention is commonly used because models like LSTMs expect the data to be in this format. However, if you're accustomed to working with more traditional tabular data in PyTorch, it can initially cause confusion. It's important to be aware of this convention to avoid potential errors and understand how to properly prepare and format sequence data for your models.\n"

    "## BLEU score metric for evaluation\n",
    "While peplexity serves as a general metric to evaluate the performance of language model in predicting the correct next token, BLEU score is helpful in evaluating the quality of the final generated translation.\n",
    "Validating the results using BLEU score is helpful when there is more than a single valid translation for a sentence as you can include many translation versions in the reference list and compare the generated translation with different versions of translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a metric commonly used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated translations by comparing them to one or more reference translations. It measures the similarity between the generated translation and the reference translations based on n-gram matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLEU score is calculated using the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision**:\n",
    "   - Precision measures the proportion of n-grams in the generated translation that appear in the reference translations.\n",
    "   - Precision is calculated for each n-gram order (1 to N) and then combined using a geometric mean.\n",
    "   - The precision for a particular n-gram order is calculated as:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\\text{Precision}_n(t) = \\frac{\\text{CountClip}_n(t)}{\\text{Count}_n(t)}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where:\n",
    "     - $\\text{CountClip}_n(t)$ is the count of n-grams in the generated translation that appear in any reference translation, clipped by the maximum count of that n-gram in any single reference translation.\n",
    "     - $\\text{Count}_n(t)$ is the count of n-grams in the generated translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. . **Brevity penalty**:\n",
    "   - The brevity penalty accounts for the fact that shorter translations tend to have higher precision scores.\n",
    "   - It encourages translations that are closer in length to the reference translations.\n",
    "   - The brevity penalty is calculated as:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  $$\\text{BP} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } c > r \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{(1 - \\frac{r}{c})} & \\text{if } c \\leq r \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where:\n",
    "     - $c$ is the total length of the generated translation.\n",
    "     - $r$ is the total length of the reference translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BLEU score**:\n",
    "   - The BLEU score is the geometric mean of the precisions, weighted by the brevity penalty.\n",
    "   - It is calculated as:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\\text{BLEU} = \\text{BP} \\cdot \\exp(\\sum_{n=1}^{N}w_n \\log(\\text{Precision}_n(t)))$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where:\n",
    "     - $N$ is the maximum n-gram order.\n",
    "     - $w_n$ is the weight assigned to the precision at n-gram order $n$, commonly set as $\\frac{1}{N}$ for equal weights.\n"
